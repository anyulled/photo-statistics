# Photo Statistics Project Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of improvement tasks for the Photo Statistics project, organized by category. Each task is designed to enhance the project's architecture, code quality, functionality, or user experience.

## Architecture Improvements

* [x] Implement a proper layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
* [x] Create a unified configuration system for all application settings
* [x] Develop a proper API layer for communication between frontend and backend
* [x] Integrate the Tauri application with the core photo-statistics functionality
* [x] Implement a proper logging system throughout the application
* [x] Create a plugin system for extensibility (e.g., additional metadata extractors, statistics generators)
* [x] Implement a proper error handling strategy across the application
* [x] Design and implement a caching strategy to avoid reprocessing unchanged files
* [x] Implement database migrations for schema versioning
* [ ] Create a proper state management system for the frontend

## Code Quality Improvements

* [x] Fix hardcoded values (database paths, API URLs, etc.)
* [x] Remove unnecessary imports (e.g., std::println in statistics.rs)
* [x] Improve error handling throughout the codebase (replace unwrap/expect with proper error handling)
* [x] Add comprehensive documentation (function docs, module docs, examples)
* [x] Standardize code style and formatting across the codebase
* [x] Refactor the worker.rs module to reduce database lock contention
* [x] Optimize database operations with transactions for batch processing
* [x] Implement proper resource cleanup and error recovery
* [x] Add input validation for user-provided paths and options
* [x] Fix the incorrect binary name in the release workflow
